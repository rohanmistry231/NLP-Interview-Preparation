## üìñ Introduction

Welcome to the **Advanced NLP** subsection of my **NLP with NLTK** roadmap for AI/ML interview preparation! üöÄ This folder explores advanced NLP techniques, integrating NLTK with modern tools like Word2Vec, GloVe, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Designed for hands-on learning and interview success, it builds on your prior roadmaps‚Äî**Python**, **TensorFlow.js**, **GenAI**, **JavaScript**, **Keras**, **Matplotlib**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Computer Vision with OpenCV (cv2)**‚Äîand supports your retail-themed projects (April 26, 2025). Whether tackling coding challenges or technical discussions, this section equips you with the skills to excel in advanced NLP roles.

## üåü What‚Äôs Inside?

- **Topic Modeling**: Perform Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with NLTK and scikit-learn.
- **Word Embeddings**: Integrate Word2Vec and GloVe for semantic word representations.
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Use TensorFlow and PyTorch for advanced NLP models.
- **Chatbot Basics**: Build a simple rule-based chatbot with NLTK.
- **Hands-on Code**: Four `.py` files with practical examples using synthetic retail text data (e.g., product reviews).
- **Interview Scenarios**: Key questions and answers to ace NLP interviews.

## üîç Who Is This For?

- NLP Engineers building advanced models.
- Machine Learning Engineers integrating deep learning with NLP.
- AI Researchers mastering topic modeling and embeddings.
- Software Engineers deepening NLP expertise.
- Anyone preparing for advanced NLP interviews in AI/ML or retail.

### üìö Topic Modeling (`topic_modeling.py`)
- LDA with NLTK and scikit-learn
- Topic Extraction
- Topic Visualization

### üåê Word Embeddings (`word_embeddings.py`)
- Word2Vec Integration
- GloVe Integration
- Embedding Visualization

### üß† Deep Learning Integration (`deep_learning_nlp.py`)
- TensorFlow Text Classification

### ü§ñ Chatbot Basics (`chatbot_basics.py`)
- Rule-Based Chatbot
- Pattern Matching
- Chatbot Interaction Demo

## üí° Why Master Advanced NLP?

Advanced NLP with NLTK is critical for cutting-edge applications, and here‚Äôs why it matters:
1. **Semantic Understanding**: Captures complex text patterns and meanings.
2. **Versatility**: Applies to retail (e.g., recommendation systems, chatbots), social media, and search.
3. **Interview Relevance**: Tested in coding challenges (e.g., topic modeling, embeddings).
4. **Foundation**: Bridges traditional NLP with modern deep learning.
5. **Industry Demand**: A must-have for 6 LPA+ NLP and AI/ML roles.

This section is your roadmap to mastering advanced NLP for technical interviews‚Äîlet‚Äôs dive in!

## üìÜ Study Plan

- **Week 1**:
  - Day 1-2: Topic Modeling
  - Day 3-4: Word Embeddings
  - Day 5-6: Deep Learning Integration
  - Day 7: Chatbot Basics
- **Week 2**:
  - Day 1-7: Review all `.py` files and practice interview scenarios.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Install Python 3.8+ and pip.
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv nlp_env; source nlp_env/bin/activate`.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install nltk numpy matplotlib scikit-learn gensim tensorflow torch`.
2. **NLTK Data**:
   - Download required NLTK datasets: Run `python -m nltk.downloader punkt stopwords`.
3. **Additional Data**:
   - Download GloVe embeddings: [GloVe 6B 50d](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) (e.g., `glove.6B.50d.txt`).
   - Place GloVe file in the working directory or adjust file path in `word_embeddings.py`.
4. **Datasets**:
   - Uses synthetic retail text data (e.g., product reviews like ‚ÄúThis laptop is great!‚Äù).
   - Optional: Download datasets like [UCI Sentiment Labeled Sentences](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences).
5. **Running Code**:
   - Run `.py` files in a Python environment (e.g., `python topic_modeling.py`).
   - Use Google Colab for convenience or local setup.
   - View outputs in terminal (console logs) and Matplotlib visualizations (saved as PNGs).
   - Check terminal for errors; ensure NLTK data and GloVe file are available.

## üèÜ Practical Tasks

1. **Topic Modeling**:
   - Apply LDA to synthetic retail reviews.
   - Visualize topic distributions.
2. **Word Embeddings**:
   - Train Word2Vec on a retail text corpus.
   - Load GloVe embeddings and compute word similarities.
3. **Deep Learning Integration**:
   - Train a TensorFlow model for sentiment classification.
   - Train a PyTorch model for the same task.
4. **Chatbot Basics**:
   - Build a rule-based chatbot for retail queries.
   - Test chatbot responses with user inputs.

## üí° Interview Tips

- **Common Questions**:
  - How does LDA work for topic modeling?
  - What are the advantages of Word2Vec over GloVe?
  - How do you integrate deep learning with NLP?
  - What are the limitations of rule-based chatbots?
