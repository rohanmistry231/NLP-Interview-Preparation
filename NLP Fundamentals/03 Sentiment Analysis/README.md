## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to the **Sentiment Analysis** subsection of my **NLP with NLTK** roadmap for AI/ML interview preparation! 🚀 This folder focuses on analyzing text sentiment using the **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**, a key skill for understanding opinions and emotions in text. Designed for hands-on learning and interview success, it builds on your prior roadmaps—**Python**, **TensorFlow.js**, **GenAI**, **JavaScript**, **Keras**, **Matplotlib**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Computer Vision with OpenCV (cv2)**—and supports your retail-themed projects (April 26, 2025). Whether tackling coding challenges or technical discussions, this section equips you with the skills to excel in NLP roles.

## 🌟 What’s Inside?

- **VADER Sentiment Analyzer**: Analyze sentiment with NLTK’s VADER tool.
- **Rule-Based Sentiment Scoring**: Implement custom sentiment rules.
- **Classifier-Based Sentiment**: Build Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers.
- **Sentiment Visualization**: Visualize sentiment scores and distributions.
- **Hands-on Code**: Four `.py` files with practical examples using synthetic retail text data (e.g., product reviews).
- **Interview Scenarios**: Key questions and answers to ace NLP interviews.

## 🔍 Who Is This For?

- NLP Engineers analyzing text sentiment.
- Machine Learning Engineers building sentiment models.
- AI Researchers mastering sentiment analysis techniques.
- Software Engineers deepening NLP expertise.
- Anyone preparing for NLP interviews in AI/ML or retail.

## 🗺️ Learning Roadmap

This subsection covers four key areas, each with a dedicated `.py` file:

### 😄 VADER Sentiment Analyzer (`vader_sentiment.py`)
- VADER Sentiment Scoring
- Compound Score Analysis
- VADER Visualization

### 📏 Rule-Based Sentiment Scoring (`rule_based_sentiment.py`)
- Custom Sentiment Rules
- Keyword-Based Scoring
- Rule-Based Visualization

### 🤖 Classifier-Based Sentiment (`classifier_sentiment.py`)
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- SVM Classifier
- Classifier Evaluation

### 📈 Sentiment Visualization (`sentiment_visualization.py`)
- Sentiment Score Plots
- Sentiment Distribution
- Comparative Visualization

## 💡 Why Master Sentiment Analysis?

Sentiment analysis with NLTK is critical for NLP, and here’s why it matters:
1. **Opinion Mining**: Understands customer sentiments in reviews and feedback.
2. **Versatility**: Applies to retail (e.g., product review analysis), social media, and customer service.
3. **Interview Relevance**: Tested in coding challenges (e.g., sentiment classification).
4. **Foundation**: Essential for building NLP applications like chatbots.
5. **Industry Demand**: A must-have for 6 LPA+ NLP and AI/ML roles.

This section is your roadmap to mastering sentiment analysis for technical interviews—let’s dive in!

## 📆 Study Plan

- **Week 1**:
  - Day 1-2: VADER Sentiment Analyzer
  - Day 3-4: Rule-Based Sentiment Scoring
  - Day 5-6: Classifier-Based Sentiment
  - Day 7: Sentiment Visualization
- **Week 2**:
  - Day 1-7: Review all `.py` files and practice interview scenarios.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Install Python 3.8+ and pip.
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv nlp_env; source nlp_env/bin/activate`.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install nltk numpy matplotlib scikit-learn`.
2. **NLTK Data**:
   - Download required NLTK datasets: Run `python -m nltk.downloader punkt vader_lexicon`.
3. **Datasets**:
   - Uses synthetic retail text data (e.g., product reviews like “This laptop is great!”).
   - Optional: Download datasets like [UCI Sentiment Labeled Sentences](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences).
4. **Running Code**:
   - Run `.py` files in a Python environment (e.g., `python vader_sentiment.py`).
   - Use Google Colab for convenience or local setup.
   - View outputs in terminal (console logs) and Matplotlib visualizations (saved as PNGs).
   - Check terminal for errors; ensure NLTK data is downloaded.

## 🏆 Practical Tasks

1. **VADER Sentiment Analyzer**:
   - Analyze sentiment of a synthetic product review using VADER.
   - Visualize compound scores.
2. **Rule-Based Sentiment Scoring**:
   - Implement custom sentiment rules for a review text.
   - Plot rule-based scores.
3. **Classifier-Based Sentiment**:
   - Train Naive Bayes and SVM classifiers on synthetic reviews.
   - Evaluate classifier performance.
4. **Sentiment Visualization**:
   - Visualize sentiment distributions across reviews.
   - Compare VADER and classifier results.

## 💡 Interview Tips

- **Common Questions**:
  - How does VADER calculate sentiment scores?
  - What are the advantages of classifier-based sentiment analysis?
  - When would you use rule-based sentiment scoring?
  - How do you visualize sentiment analysis results?
- **Tips**:
  - Explain VADER’s compound score (e.g., `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer`).
  - Demonstrate classifier training (e.g., `NaiveBayesClassifier`).
  - Be ready to code tasks like sentiment scoring or classifier evaluation.
  - Discuss trade-offs (e.g., VADER vs. classifiers, rule-based vs. ML).
- **Coding Tasks**:
  - Implement VADER sentiment analysis on a review.
  - Train a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment.
  - Visualize sentiment scores for a dataset.
- **Conceptual Clarity**:
  - Explain VADER’s lexicon-based approach.
  - Describe how classifiers handle imbalanced data.
