## üìñ Introduction

Welcome to the **NLP with NLTK** section of my AI/ML interview preparation roadmap! üöÄ This folder introduces Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**, a powerful Python library for text processing and analysis. Designed for hands-on learning and interview success, it builds on your prior roadmaps‚Äî**Python** (e.g., `neural_networks.py`), **TensorFlow.js** (e.g., `ai_ml_javascript.js`), **GenAI** (e.g., `rag.py`), **JavaScript**, **Keras**, **Matplotlib** (e.g., `basic_plotting.py`), **Pandas** (e.g., `basic_operations.py`), **NumPy** (e.g., `array_creation_properties.py`), and **Computer Vision with OpenCV (cv2)** (e.g., `image_basics.py`, `deep_learning_detection.py`)‚Äîand supports your retail-themed projects (April 26, 2025). Whether tackling coding challenges or technical discussions, this section equips you with the skills to excel in NLP and AI/ML roles.

## üåü What‚Äôs Inside?

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
- **Text Analysis**: Part-of-speech (POS) tagging, named entity recognition (NER), and frequency analysis.

## üí° Why Master NLP with NLTK?

NLP with NLTK is essential for AI/ML, and here‚Äôs why it matters:
1. **Text Understanding**: Enables processing and analyzing unstructured text data.
2. **Versatility**: Applies to retail (e.g., review analysis, chatbots), customer service, and social media.
3. **Interview Relevance**: Tested in coding challenges (e.g., sentiment analysis, text classification).
4. **Foundation**: NLTK provides a beginner-friendly entry to NLP concepts.
5. **Industry Demand**: A must-have for 6 LPA+ NLP and AI/ML roles.

This section is your roadmap to mastering NLTK for NLP in technical interviews‚Äîlet‚Äôs dive in!

## üìÜ Study Plan

- **Week 1**: Text Preprocessing
- **Week 2**: Text Analysis
- **Week 3**: Sentiment Analysis
- **Week 4**: Text Classification
- **Week 5**: Advanced NLP
- **Daily Practice**: Study concepts, run future `.py` files, and review interview scenarios.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Install Python 3.8+ and pip.
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv nlp_env; source nlp_env/bin/activate`.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install nltk numpy matplotlib scikit-learn`.
2. **NLTK Data**:
   - Download NLTK datasets: Run `python -m nltk.downloader all` or specific packages (e.g., `punkt`, `wordnet`, `vader_lexicon`, `averaged_perceptron_tagger`).
3. **Datasets**:
   - Uses synthetic text data (e.g., retail product reviews) for demos.
   - Optional: Download datasets like [UCI Sentiment Labeled Sentences](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences) or [NLTK Corpora](https://www.nltk.org/data.html).
4. **Running Code**:
   - Future `.py` files will be executable in a Python environment (e.g., `python text_preprocessing.py`).
   - Use Google Colab for convenience or local setup.
   - View outputs in terminal (console logs) and Matplotlib visualizations (saved as PNGs).
   - Check terminal for errors; ensure NLTK data is downloaded.

## üèÜ Practical Tasks

1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenize and lemmatize a synthetic product review.
   - Remove stopwords from a retail text dataset.
2. **Text Analysis**:
   - Perform POS tagging on a customer feedback text.
   - Extract named entities from a synthetic review.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Analyze sentiment of a product review using VADER.
   - Build a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment.
4. **Text Classification**:
   - Classify synthetic reviews as positive/negative using TF-IDF.
   - Evaluate classifier performance with F1-score.
5. **Advanced NLP**:
   - Perform topic modeling on synthetic retail texts.
   - Integrate Word2Vec with NLTK for word similarity.

## üí° Interview Tips

  - Demonstrate sentiment analysis steps (e.g., `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer`).
  - Be ready to code tasks like POS tagging or text classification.
  - Discuss trade-offs (e.g., NLTK vs. spaCy, rule-based vs. deep learning).
- **Coding Tasks**:
  - Implement tokenization and stemming on a text.
  - Build a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis.
  - Perform NER on a synthetic dataset.
- **Conceptual Clarity**:
  - Explain why lemmatization is preferred over stemming.
  - Describe how TF-IDF improves over Bag-of-Words.
