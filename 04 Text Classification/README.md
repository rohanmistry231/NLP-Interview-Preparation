## üìñ Introduction

Welcome to the **Text Classification** subsection of my **NLP with NLTK** roadmap for AI/ML interview preparation! üöÄ This folder focuses on building text classification models using the **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)** and scikit-learn, a core skill for tasks like spam detection and sentiment analysis. Designed for hands-on learning and interview success, it builds on your prior roadmaps‚Äî**Python**, **TensorFlow.js**, **GenAI**, **JavaScript**, **Keras**, **Matplotlib**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Computer Vision with OpenCV (cv2)**‚Äîand supports your retail-themed projects (April 26, 2025). Whether tackling coding challenges or technical discussions, this section equips you with the skills to excel in NLP roles.

## üåü What‚Äôs Inside?

- **Bag-of-Words Model**: Represent text as word frequency vectors.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Weight words by importance using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency.
- **Classifiers**: Train Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measure performance with accuracy and F1-score.
- **Hands-on Code**: Four `.py` files with practical examples using synthetic retail text data (e.g., product reviews).
- **Interview Scenarios**: Key questions and answers to ace NLP interviews.

## üîç Who Is This For?

- NLP Engineers building text classification models.
- Machine Learning Engineers applying classifiers to text.
- AI Researchers mastering text classification techniques.
- Software Engineers deepening NLP expertise.
- Anyone preparing for NLP interviews in AI/ML or retail.

## üó∫Ô∏è Learning Roadmap

This subsection covers four key areas, each with a dedicated `.py` file:

### üìö Bag-of-Words Model (`bag_of_words.py`)
- Text Vectorization
- BoW Feature Extraction
- BoW Visualization

### üìä TF-IDF Vectorization (`tfidf_vectorization.py`)
- TF-IDF Calculation
- Feature Weighting
- TF-IDF Visualization

### ü§ñ Classifiers (`classifiers.py`)
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Logistic Regression Classifier
- Model Training and Prediction

### üìà Evaluation Metrics (`evaluation_metrics.py`)
- Accuracy Calculation
- F1-Score Calculation
- Performance Visualization

## üí° Why Master Text Classification?

Text classification with NLTK is critical for NLP, and here‚Äôs why it matters:
1. **Automated Labeling**: Classifies text for tasks like sentiment analysis and spam detection.
2. **Versatility**: Applies to retail (e.g., review classification), customer service, and social media.
3. **Interview Relevance**: Tested in coding challenges (e.g., build a classifier).
4. **Foundation**: Essential for advanced NLP models like deep learning.
5. **Industry Demand**: A must-have for 6 LPA+ NLP and AI/ML roles.

This section is your roadmap to mastering text classification for technical interviews‚Äîlet‚Äôs dive in!

## üìÜ Study Plan

- **Week 1**:
  - Day 1-2: Bag-of-Words Model
  - Day 3-4: TF-IDF Vectorization
  - Day 5-6: Classifiers
  - Day 7: Evaluation Metrics
- **Week 2**:
  - Day 1-7: Review all `.py` files and practice interview scenarios.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Install Python 3.8+ and pip.
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv nlp_env; source nlp_env/bin/activate`.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install nltk numpy matplotlib scikit-learn`.
2. **NLTK Data**:
   - Download required NLTK datasets: Run `python -m nltk.downloader punkt stopwords`.
3. **Datasets**:
   - Uses synthetic retail text data (e.g., product reviews like ‚ÄúThis laptop is great!‚Äù).
   - Optional: Download datasets like [UCI Sentiment Labeled Sentences](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences).
4. **Running Code**:
   - Run `.py` files in a Python environment (e.g., `python bag_of_words.py`).
   - Use Google Colab for convenience or local setup.
   - View outputs in terminal (console logs) and Matplotlib visualizations (saved as PNGs).
   - Check terminal for errors; ensure NLTK data is downloaded.

## üèÜ Practical Tasks

1. **Bag-of-Words Model**:
   - Vectorize synthetic reviews using Bag-of-Words.
   - Visualize word frequency vectors.
2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**:
   - Apply TF-IDF to a review dataset.
   - Plot TF-IDF weights for key terms.
3. **Classifiers**:
   - Train Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression on synthetic reviews.
   - Predict sentiment for new reviews.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Compute accuracy and F1-score for classifiers.
   - Visualize performance metrics.

## üí° Interview Tips

- **Common Questions**:
  - What is the Bag-of-Words model, and what are its limitations?
  - How does TF-IDF improve over Bag-of-Words?
  - Compare Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression for text classification.
  - Why use F1-score instead of accuracy?
- **Tips**:
  - Explain BoW with code (e.g., `CountVectorizer`).
  - Demonstrate TF-IDF vectorization (e.g., `TfidfVectorizer`).
  - Be ready to code tasks like classifier training or metric calculation.
  - Discuss trade-offs (e.g., BoW vs. TF-IDF, Naive Bayes vs. Logistic Regression).
- **Coding Tasks**:
  - Implement Bag-of-Words for a text dataset.
  - Train a Logistic Regression classifier for sentiment.
  - Calculate F1-score for a classifier.
- **Conceptual Clarity**:
  - Explain how TF-IDF weights terms.
  - Describe the assumptions of Naive Bayes.
