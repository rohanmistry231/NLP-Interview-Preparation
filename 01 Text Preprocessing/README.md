## üìñ Introduction

Welcome to the **Text Preprocessing** subsection of my **NLP with NLTK** roadmap for AI/ML interview preparation! üöÄ This folder focuses on preparing text data for NLP tasks using the **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**, a foundational step in any NLP pipeline. Designed for hands-on learning and interview success, it builds on your prior roadmaps‚Äî**Python** (e.g., `neural_networks.py`), **TensorFlow.js** (e.g., `ai_ml_javascript.js`), **GenAI** (e.g., `rag.py`), **JavaScript**, **Keras**, **Matplotlib** (e.g., `basic_plotting.py`), **Pandas** (e.g., `basic_operations.py`), **NumPy** (e.g., `array_creation_properties.py`), and **Computer Vision with OpenCV (cv2)** (e.g., `image_basics.py`, `deep_learning_detection.py`)‚Äîand supports your retail-themed projects (April 26, 2025). Whether tackling coding challenges or technical discussions, this section equips you with the skills to excel in NLP roles.

## üåü What‚Äôs Inside?

- **Tokenization**: Split text into words and sentences.
- **Stemming**: Reduce words to their root forms using Porter and Snowball stemmers.
- **Lemmatization**: Normalize words to their base forms using WordNet.
- **Stopword Removal**: Remove common words that add little meaning.
- **Text Normalization**: Standardize text by handling case and punctuation.
- **Hands-on Code**: Five `.py` files with practical examples using synthetic retail text data (e.g., product reviews).
- **Interview Scenarios**: Key questions and answers to ace NLP interviews.

## üîç Who Is This For?

- NLP Engineers starting with text preprocessing.
- Machine Learning Engineers preparing text for modeling.
- AI Researchers mastering NLP pipelines.
- Software Engineers deepening NLP expertise.
- Anyone preparing for NLP interviews in AI/ML or retail.

## üó∫Ô∏è Learning Roadmap

This subsection covers five key areas, each with a dedicated `.py` file:

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Tokenization (`tokenization.py`)
- Word Tokenization
- Sentence Tokenization
- Token Visualization

### üå± Stemming (`stemming.py`)
- Porter Stemmer
- Snowball Stemmer
- Stemming Comparison

### üçã Lemmatization (`lemmatization.py`)
- WordNet Lemmatizer
- POS-Aware Lemmatization
- Lemmatization vs. Stemming

### üö´ Stopword Removal (`stopword_removal.py`)
- NLTK Stopword List
- Custom Stopwords
- Impact on Text Analysis

### üßπ Text Normalization (`text_normalization.py`)
- Case Normalization
- Punctuation Removal
- Whitespace Handling

## üí° Why Master Text Preprocessing?

Text preprocessing with NLTK is critical for NLP, and here‚Äôs why it matters:
1. **Data Quality**: Cleans and structures text for downstream tasks.
2. **Versatility**: Applies to retail (e.g., review analysis), chatbots, and search systems.
3. **Interview Relevance**: Tested in coding challenges (e.g., tokenization, stopword removal).
4. **Foundation**: Preprocessing is the first step in any NLP pipeline.
5. **Industry Demand**: A must-have for 6 LPA+ NLP and AI/ML roles.

This section is your roadmap to mastering text preprocessing for technical interviews‚Äîlet‚Äôs dive in!

## üìÜ Study Plan

- **Week 1**:
  - Day 1-2: Tokenization
  - Day 3-4: Stemming
  - Day 5-6: Lemmatization
  - Day 7: Stopword Removal
- **Week 2**:
  - Day 1-2: Text Normalization
  - Day 3-7: Review all `.py` files and practice interview scenarios.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Python Environment**:
   - Install Python 3.8+ and pip.
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv nlp_env; source nlp_env/bin/activate`.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install nltk numpy matplotlib`.
2. **NLTK Data**:
   - Download required NLTK datasets: Run `python -m nltk.downloader punkt wordnet stopwords averaged_perceptron_tagger omw-1.4`.
3. **Datasets**:
   - Uses synthetic retail text data (e.g., product reviews like ‚ÄúThis laptop is great!‚Äù).
   - Optional: Download datasets like [UCI Sentiment Labeled Sentences](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences).
4. **Running Code**:
   - Run `.py` files in a Python environment (e.g., `python tokenization.py`).
   - Use Google Colab for convenience or local setup.
   - View outputs in terminal (console logs) and Matplotlib visualizations (saved as PNGs).
   - Check terminal for errors; ensure NLTK data is downloaded.

## üèÜ Practical Tasks

1. **Tokenization**:
   - Tokenize a synthetic product review into words and sentences.
   - Visualize token frequency with a bar plot.
2. **Stemming**:
   - Apply Porter and Snowball stemmers to a review text.
   - Compare stemming results for accuracy.
3. **Lemmatization**:
   - Lemmatize words in a customer feedback text.
   - Test POS-aware lemmatization for verbs and nouns.
4. **Stopword Removal**:
   - Remove stopwords from a synthetic review.
   - Analyze the impact on word frequency.
5. **Text Normalization**:
   - Normalize case and remove punctuation from a retail text.
   - Standardize whitespace in a messy text.

## üí° Interview Tips

- **Common Questions**:
  - What is the difference between stemming and lemmatization?
  - Why is tokenization important in NLP?
  - When should you remove stopwords?
  - How does text normalization affect NLP performance?
- **Tips**:
  - Explain tokenization with code (e.g., `nltk.word_tokenize()`).
  - Demonstrate stemming vs. lemmatization (e.g., `PorterStemmer` vs. `WordNetLemmatizer`).
  - Be ready to code tasks like stopword removal or case normalization.
  - Discuss trade-offs (e.g., stemming speed vs. lemmatization accuracy).
- **Coding Tasks**:
  - Implement word and sentence tokenization on a text.
  - Apply lemmatization to a list of words.
  - Remove stopwords and normalize a review text.
- **Conceptual Clarity**:
  - Explain why lemmatization requires POS tagging.
  - Describe the impact of stopwords on text classification.
